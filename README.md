Quantum Cryptography Prototype

Overview
The Quantum Cryptography Prototype is an interactive web application demonstrating a simulated quantum encryption process. This project showcases a proprietary quantum-inspired encryption algorithm, Q6Fold, through an intuitive user interface, real-time visualizations, and engaging animations. Built with modern web technologies, it provides an educational and visually appealing experience to explore quantum cryptography concepts.

  'energy-aura': '#00aaff',
}

Animation Settings
Animation durations and easing functions can be customized in tailwind.config.js:
animation: {
  'quantum-glow': 'quantum-glow 3s ease-in-out infinite',
  'particle-float': 'particle-float 4s ease-in-out infinite',
}
